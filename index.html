    <h3>What is Conveyor Belt Sushi?</h3>
    <p>Conveyor belt sushi, (also called sushi-go-round) mainly by foreigners living in Japan, is the popular English translation for Japanese fast-food sushi. In Australia, it is also known as sushi-train (as the sushi goes around a track on a train rather than a conveyor belt.) In South Korea, conveyor belt sushi has become popular and is known as “revolving sushi”. Kaiten-sushi is a sushi restaurant where the plates with the sushi are placed on a rotating conveyor belt that winds through the restaurant and moves past every table and counter seat. Customers may place special orders but most simply pick their selections from a steady stream of fresh sushi moving along the conveyor belt.  The final bill is based on the number and color of plates of the consumed sushi.</p>
